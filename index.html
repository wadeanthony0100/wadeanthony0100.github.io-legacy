  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    I'm a BS Software Engineering student at Rochester Institute of Technology, expecting to graduate in 2019. I've worked as a Course Assistant and as a Student Lab Instructor for technical classes at RIT. I've also worked as a Co-op at Intuit in San Diego, California. If you're interested in learning more, take a look at my résumé and my Github, and feel free to reach out to me with any questions.
